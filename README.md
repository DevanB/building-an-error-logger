##### The Meteor Chef
######Building an Error Logger

In this recipe, we'll learn how to build a custom error logging system for Meteor. We'll build a simple API for ingesting errors as well as a utility class for sending errors to that API. We'll also build a simple interface for outputting those errors for review later and play with setting expiration dates on documents in MongoDB.
